FMCakeMix is a FileMaker datasource driver for the CakePHP MVC framework. FMCakeMix enables FileMaker databases to integrate into Cake as if they were native SQL based sources, allowing for rapid development of FileMaker based web solutions in a modern web application development framework.

Installation

Download and follow the installation instructions from the cake website http://cakephp.org/.

FX.php is PHP class created by Chris Hansen to speak with FileMaker via XML. The FMCakeMix driver uses fx.php to send queries to FileMaker and is necessary for the driver’s functionality. Install FX.php by downloading the files from http://www.iviking.org/FX.php/ and placing the FX.php, FX_Error.php, FX_Constants.php, and image_proxy.php files at the root of the yourcakeinstall/vendors folder.

Because the driver uses XML to communicate with FileMaker, your FileMaker solutions must be hosted on a version of FileMaker Server that supports web publishing and xml access. See the FileMaker Server documentation for instructions on enabling these features.

Install the dbo_fmcakemix.php file into yourcakeinstall/app/models/datasources/dbo, you’ll likely have to create the dbo directory in the datasources folder.
